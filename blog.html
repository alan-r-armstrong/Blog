            <h2>Cast of characters</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ruckus - a grey tabby</li>
                <li>Hera - a black and white shorthair</li>
                <li>Boxer - a grey and white shorthair</li>
                <li>Pepe - an Australian shepard</li>
                <li>Bella - a beagle</li>
            </ul>
        <p>First, the kitties:</p>
            <div>
                <img src="images/IMG_0341.JPG" alt="2 cats snoozing on rug, one a grey tabby, the other black and white shorthair" width="700" height="600">
                <img src="images/IMG_E0346.JPG" alt="grey and white cat snoozing under desk" width="700" height="600">
            </div>
        <p>As you can see, there is a lot of action happening here.  Ruckus is the oldest and was a rescue from the San Francisco SPCA, he is 15 years old.  After we got to know him and how much noise he liked to make in the night, and general trouble he liked to get into, he earned his name.  He has mellowed out considerably as he's aged.
        Next we have Hera.  We adopted Hera from the Austin Humane Society.  As soon as we entered her cage she immediately came up to us and started nuzzling us and at that point we knew she had picked us.  She is very particular about her food and accomodations.  If everything isn't purrfect, she let's us know of her displeasure.  She is 11 years old.
        The last of our feline family is Boxer.  His momma was a barn kitty and had him about 1 year ago.  We settled on the name Boxer when he started playfully throwing hands with our kids.  He has turned into a night terror, he really ejoys walking on the piano keys and batting around lego bricks in the middle of the night.
